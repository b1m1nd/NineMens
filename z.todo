// See in-file comments for ideas 💡
// Creating better "mill" logic with help with refactoring.

Logic Todo:
  ☐ Roll to start 
  ☐ Player captured count
  ☐ Winning logic / error logic
  ☐ Restart button
  ☐ Modal popup with directions
  
  Player moves:
    // logic for after all peices are used playerMove()
    ✔ only horizontal moves working @done(20-06-13 23:11)
    ☐ Cant move to same spot
    ☐ Only move one space
    ☐ Fly rule after <= 3 captured (free to move any where)
    ☐ prevent mill from del unless only left
  

UI/UX:
  ✔ class highlight for mill @done(20-06-13 03:00)
  ✔ players board with count and turn color @done(20-06-13 03:01)
  ☐ color players and wrappers
  ☐ captured players value
  ☐ winnning text/effects
  ☐ tye in css vars
  ☐ make animation todo list*wishlist
  ☐ add icons ?
