// See in-file comments for ideas 💡
// Creating better "mill" logic with help with refactoring.

Logic Todo:
  ☐ Roll to start 
  ☐ Player moves limit after allOnBoard = true
  ☐ Player captured count
  ☐ Fly rule after <= 3 captured
  ☐ prevent mill from del unless only left

UI/UX:
  ✔ class highlight for mill @done(20-06-13 03:00)
  ✔ players board with count and turn color @done(20-06-13 03:01)
  ☐ color players and wrappers
  ☐ captured players value
  ☐ tye in css vars
  ☐ make animation todo list*wishlist
  ☐ add icons ?
